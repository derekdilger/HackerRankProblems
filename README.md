This repo contains my solutions to hackerrank problems

folders are named after the category of problem  

files are named after the problem they solve  
i.e. this  
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/bash-tutorials---arithmetic-operations/problem  
becomes named 'arithmeticOperations.sh'  

Because java problems require the solution class to be called 'Solution',  
each problem is given its own folder (i.e. namespace) to prevent name clashes  

solutions made and verified in bash terminal (ubuntu)
